\section{Preliminary Idea}

The main idea of this project is to develop a mobile application that contributes to the reduce of food waste 
in restaurants and bakeries. We want to offer a platform where these shops can log, register themselves and offer
products that were not consumed on the current day, but are still fresh and at the same time would not be sold on 
the next day. 

These products should cost much less as the normal price. The goal is to avoid that these shops deals with big losses 
and at the same time they can offer a different kind of experiencie to potential or to current clients.

Users would have the option to log, register themselves and browse on the app to see what restaurant or bakeries
are offering remaining products and up to what time their purchase may be collected.
