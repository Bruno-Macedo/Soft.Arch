\section{Organization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Name: Bruno Macedo da Silva
    \item Topic: “Fast food delivery service - web and/or mobile application with backend and business functionality”
    \item Group: Tom Braum (“Distributed, scalable software architecture for massively-multiplayer online (app or 
    client-based) games), XXXXX
\end{itemize}

\section{Preliminary Idea}

The main idea of this project is to develop a mobile application that contributes to the reduce of food waste 
in restaurants and bakeries. We want to offer a platform where these shops can log, register themselves and offer
products that were not consumed on the current day, but are still fresh and at the same time would not be sold on 
the next day. These products should cost much less as the normal price. The goal is to avoid that these shops deals
with big losses and at the same time they can offer a different kind of experiencie to potential or to current clients.

Users would have the option to log, register themselves and browse on the app to see what restaurant or bakeries
are offering remaining products. They would also see up to what time their purchase may be collected.

This idea was inspired in other applications that have a similar go, reduce food waste. The apps that was used as Inspiration
were ``Too Good to Go'', ``ShareTheMeal'' and ``Food to Save''.

\section{Architectural Drivers}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Design Purpose}:
    \item \textbf{Quality Attributes}: usability, availability, modifiability, security
    \item \textbf{Preliminary Functionality}: input of availability of restaurant/bakery, select restaurant/bakery, 
    register payment
    \item \textbf{Architectural Concerns}: programming language, connection with payment server, authentication
    \item \textbf{Constraints}: time, financial, platform (iOS, Android)
\end{itemize}
