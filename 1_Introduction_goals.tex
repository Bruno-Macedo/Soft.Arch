\section{Introduction and Goals}

According to the \acrfull{fao} in 2019 931 millions tonnes of food were wasted \cite{refart:FAOFW}. This has
environmental, but special social consequences. In a world were approximately 9.9\% of the \cite{refart:AAHWH}
population suffers from hunger that waste percentage sounds paradoxal.

According to \acrfull{un} 5\% of the globally food loss and waste comes from restaurants \cite{refart:UNSP}. 
The solution for this problem muss be locally applied so its effects can be seen in a global structure. To do so we
propose to develop a mobile application that connects restaurants, bakeries and or pastries to clients. 
The former would offer their remaining products, which are still consumable, prior to the closing time, to a small price 
and the latter would browser in the app to find which shops are offering products. 

 
\subsection*{Use cases}

The following use cases were defined according to the main purpose of the application:

    \toprule
    ID & Quality Attribute & Scenario & Associated Use Case  \\
    \midrule
    QA-1 & 123 & A client register their e-mail address and he can immediate browse in the app. & UC-1 \\
    QA-2 & 123 & A client login in the app and he can immediate browse in the app. & UC-2 \\
    QA-3 & 123 & A client choose a provider and place his order. After the confirmation
    of payment, a push-message is displayed in the app confirming the purchase. & UC-3 \\
    QA-4 & 123 & A client register his credit card or select another payment method and the
    confirmation as soon as he confirmed with his provider. & UC-4 \\
    QA-5 & 123 & A provider is able to register his company, specify the kind of products he offers and upload
    a logo or picture of his shop. & UC-05 \\
    QA-6 & 123 & A provider is able to update in the app if he is offering for that day any product. &  UC-6 \\

Check Add 3.0
Check FAO for reasoning
Define Drivers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Design Purpose: prototype, check acceptance
    \item Quality
    \item Primary Functionality: realy first to get the system to start, food ordering, registering, offering
    \item Constraints: laws, deadlines, standards
    \item Concerns: can be left blank
\end{itemize}

pick 3 qualities

Quality: A ==> Create Scenarios ==> Prioritize High, Medium, Low for (Arch, Customer)
Quality: usability ==> Create Scenarios ==> Prioritize (for Arch, for Customer) 
Quality: availability ==> Create Scenarios 
Quality: modifiability ==> Create Scenarios
Quality: security ==> Create Scenarios
