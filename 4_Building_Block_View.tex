\section{Building Block View}

In this section we will describe the \gls{app} using some elements of the 4+1 Architectural View Model. With this model we
aim to target an understanding of all our main stakeholders.

We will use 4 different views, which should focus on specific elements of the project. Each view provides a different
purpose \cite{refart:KR41}. For this project we will provide the 3 following views of the 4+1 Architectural View 
Model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scenario view}: simple description for the end user 
    \item \textbf{Structural view}: object-oriented decomposition
    \item \textbf{Behavior view}: description of the existing processes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scenario view}

Our first picture \ref{fig:preliminary_use_case} provided our stakeholders a brief presentation of the basic functionalities of our app. Other elements addressed in this view were presented in the chapter where we discussed the business context, \ref{business_context}. 

An example on how each feature of the app should work can be found in our use case in section \ref{table_use_case}.
More elements of this view will be presented while discussing the internal decisions in chapter \ref{Patterns_Tacticts}. 

\subsection{Structural view}

For the following graphic we choose a \gls{class diagram} to provide our development team a further view of the
structural elements of the project. This first class diagram gives a simple description of the classes that can
exist in the app.

Zooming down the classes we presented before, we can see how they are build with its attributes, methods and
interaction with other elements.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Behavior view}

The following \gls{activity diagram} depicts the register and login procedure within the app. It should explain our
main stakeholders, \glsplural{provider} and \glsplural{client}, the starting process of the app.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{assets/login_AC.jpg}
    \caption{Login procedures}
    \label{fig:login_register}
\end{figure}

To help understanding the above process we created the following \gls{sequence diagram} that depict the communication flow 
with the third party providers. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{assets/sequence_login_payment.jpg}
    \caption{Sequence of actions with third party applications}
    \label{fig:sequence_login_payment}
