\section{Quality Requirements}

\subsection{Quality Tree}

\subsection{Evaluation Scenarios} 
From the requirements, \ref{Requirement_Overview}, we could develop the following uses cases and depict the main quality 
attributes of this project. 

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
    \toprule
    Use Case & Description  \\
    \midrule
    UC-1: Register as \gls{client} & The \gls{client} registers an e-mail address.\\
    UC-2: Login & The \gls{client} logins in to the system. \\
    UC-3: Places an order & The \gls{client} chooses a \gls{provider}. \\
    UC-4: Register payment & The \gls{client} registers a payment method. \\
    UC-5: Register as \gls{provider} & The \gls{provider} registers their facility and products. \\
    UC-6: Update availability & The \gls{provider} uploads their product catalog. \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}


With the given use cases we will then be able to define the major quality attributes that are involved in the 
development of this application. We want those qualities to be measurable and testable so we can verify if the 
system meets the needs our \glsplural{stakeholder} \cite{refbook:DSHC}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \setstretch{1.0}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lcXc}
        \toprule
        ID & Quality Attribute & Scenario & Associated Use Case  \\
        \midrule
        QA-1 & Performance & A \gls{client} registers his/her e-mail address and can immediately browse in the app. & UC-1 \\
        QA-2 & Performance & A \gls{client} opens the app and he can immediately browse in the app. & UC-2 \\
        QA-3 & Performance & A \gls{client} chooses a \gls{provider} and places his order. After the confirmation
        of payment, a push-message is displayed in the app confirming the purchase. & UC-3 \\
        QA-4 & Usability & A \gls{provider} is able to register his company, specify the kind of products he offers and upload
        a logo or picture of his shop. & UC-5 \\
        QA-5 & Usability & A \gls{provider} is able to update in the app if he is offering for that day any product. &  UC-6 \\
        QA-6 & Interoperability & A \gls{client} can register his e-mail using another account (Google, Microsoft, Facebook)
        in a \gls{federated login} & UC-1 \\
        QA-8 & Interoperability & A \gls{client} can pay the order using a \gls{mobile payment gateway} (e.g. Stripe, Square, PayPay, 
        SecurePay) & UC-4 \\

The defined quality attributes are represented in the following scenarios:
