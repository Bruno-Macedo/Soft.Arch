\section{Architecture Constraints}

In this project we must distinguish between Technical (CT-T-\#) and Business (CT-B-\#) Constraints. The former describes specific elements
of the project, like programming language, released platform (e.g. operational systems) and technical decisions related to 
the functionalities. The latter deals with management elements [\cite{refonline:EFAD}] (e.g time, budget and team). The following
tables describes the technical and the business constraints of this project: 

\begin{table}[H]
    \setstretch{1.0}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|c|X|}
        \hline
        \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Technical}} \\
        \hline
        \toprule
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{Id} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Constraint} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Description} \\
        \midrule
        CT-T-1 & Programming Language & A multilanguage (Java, Kotlin, iOS, Swift) approach increases
        the maintainability burden and consequently the costs (see CT-B-4). It can also interfere with
        compatibility with different kind of device.s  \\ 
        CT-T-2 & Platform & Offering the application for different platforms (iOS and/or Android) increases
        costs for maintainability and requires a bigger team. Since the prototype should run during the
        first year mainly to gather information about consumer behavior the costs in this test phase can
        increase rapidly if we decide to develop for the most common platforms. \\ 
        CT-T-3 & Payment & One the one hand creating an own payment framework can gives full control of the application,
        but on the other hand it will required specialized team and increases costs and time (see CT-B-4). \\
        CT-T-4 & Payment gateway & Using existing \gls{mobile payment gateway} reduces development time, but demands
        fully Interoperability of the app with the existing gateways. It may also be a problem if the \gls{client}
        don't use this kind of payment method. \\
        CT-T-5 & Login & Using existing \gls{federated login} decreases development time, but like CT-T-4 demands
        fully interoperability of the app with appliances. It may also be a problem if the \gls{client}
        don't trust this kind of login. \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
    \setstretch{1.0}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|c|X|}
        \hline
        \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Business}} \\
        \hline
        \toprule
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{Id} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Constraint} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Reasoning} \\
        \midrule
        CT-B-1 & Time to first prototype release & How much time is acceptable from starting the project
        until we have a functional prototype that can be used by our user? \\
        CT-B-2 & Development Team & The existing team can cover the main existing platforms, but their availability
        may be restricted to due work on other projects Specially for the maintainability of the app it can represents
        a problem. \\
        CT-B-3 & Analytical Team & During running phase of the prototype it will be necessary to have a team in charge
        of evaluating and interpreting the collected data, to find out if the goals are being achieved. \\
        CT-B-4 & Budget & Since this application falls in the category ```middle app'' according to [\cite{refonline:SPDLOAD}]
        the available budget of US\$ 150.000 should cover the development of the main functionality and the data analysis 
        (see CT-B-3) \\
        \bottomrule
